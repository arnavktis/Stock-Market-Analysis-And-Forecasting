Welcome to the Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting project! This repository contains code and resources for analyzing and forecasting stock market trends using various machine-learning techniques.

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Jupyter Notebook**: This project uses Jupyter Notebook for running and displaying the code. You can install it using pip.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stock-Market-Analysis-And-Forecasting.git
cd Stock-Market-Analysis-And-Forecasting
```

#### 2. Install Python

Download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### 3. Install Jupyter Notebook

You can install Jupyter Notebook via pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

Alternatively, you can install it as part of the Anaconda distribution, which comes with many scientific libraries pre-installed:

- [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

#### 4. Install Required Libraries

Navigate to the project directory and install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 5. Run Jupyter Notebook

Start Jupyter Notebook by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new tab in your default web browser. From there, navigate to the project directory and open the notebook files.

## üìä Project Overview

The project includes several Jupyter Notebooks that cover different aspects of stock market analysis and forecasting:

- **Data Collection**: Scripts to collect historical stock data from various sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analyses to understand the data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various models to forecast stock prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics and plots to evaluate the performance of the models.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser.
2. Navigate to the desired notebook (e.g., `data_collection.ipynb`).
3. Run the cells step-by-step to execute the code.

## üìö Documentation

Detailed documentation is provided within each notebook. Make sure to read the comments and markdown cells for a better understanding of the workflow and the methodologies used.
